        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Explore my virtual space! I'm Daniel Lujo, a motivated computer science student eager to gain hands-on experience in software engineering. I'm seeking a challenging 
            opportunity to contribute to real-world projects, elevate my coding skills, and learn from experienced professionals.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            My journey began at the University of South Florida, where I made the decision to pursue a B.S. in Computer Science. 
            Since then I've dedicated myself to refining my programming prowess, delving into various programming languages such as Python, C, C++, and C#. 
            Throughout my academic journey, I've had the privilege of collaborating on some exhilarating projects, such as creating a remote-controlled robot operated through a personally developed Android app.
            I also took a leading role in assembling and developing the code for a line-following robot.
            I absolutley thrive on a good challenge, firmly convinced that regardless of one's starting point, diligent effort ultimately reaps its rewards.
